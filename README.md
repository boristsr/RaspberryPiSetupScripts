# RaspberryPiSetupScripts
Scripts that allow easy configuration of new raspberry pi test systems.

# THESE SCRIPTS ARE FOR TEST/DEVELOPMENT USE ONLY
Note, these scripts contain a hardcoded password which is used for the setup samba shared folder. This is a major security hole.
These scripts are purely for configuring test and development systems.
